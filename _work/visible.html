description: It's clear the web is missing a key tool when everyone is sharing addresses, dates, media and more in static text docs like it's still 2010. Visible lets anyone create interactive and shareable maps, calendars, galleries, and more to communicate information the way it was meant to be seen. More than a knowledge-base or fancy spreadsheet, Visible is a new lens on information combining all the powers of the modern web in one place.
