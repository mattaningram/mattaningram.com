<p class="page-copy">Building a professional big business facing web app with only a handful of designers and developers alongside means you have to wear a lot of hats. My primary responsibility was leading the design team in creating and refining a user interface which conveys a large amount of complex data through an elegant and insightful experience. However my day to day involved building and maintaining the HTML and CSS for the entire web app, communicating design and development needs to the CEO and other teams at Canvs, and integrating and managing user analytics and customer success technology to better serve our clients' needs.</p>

<p class="page-copy">Everything starts with a sketch, followed by more sketches, iterating towards a solution. Whether it's a new data-insight component or an interactive D3 generated chart, my goal is to communicate to my fellow designers and team leads what problem we are trying to solve, how we might solve it, and the benefits or downsides of each approach. In short order a clear direction emerges.</p>

<p class="page-copy">Once everyone involved was on the same page, I jumped to prototyping the feature in HTML/CSS while one of my talented designers developed its aesthetics and details in Sketch. In a startup of less than 30 people with limited resources, the typical user interface development process is compressed and overlaps.</p>
