      <h3 class="page-copy-header">Who I am</h3>

      <p class="page-copy">Just another sci-fi junkie raised on the 1984 Macintosh who can't stand to write about myself. Born in New York City, educated on the internet, and exercised on my bike. Since I can't go to space (allergic to space dust), I decided to orbit the planet at low altitude by heading East until I hit America. Here I am again.</p>

      <h3 class="page-copy-header">What I do</h3>

      <p class="page-copy">I like to solve problems by applying design-based thinking to the technology available. Most problems are simpler than we realize, and most proposed solutions are more complex than necessary. I find that happy middle-ground where products thrive and businesses grow.</p>

      <h3 class="page-copy-header">What I know</h3>

      <p class="page-copy">Give me any design, and I can prototype it in HTML and SASS, with a dash of Javascript. Show me an interface, and I will refine it to a shining polish with nary a pixel missed. Describe a product's context and goal, and I will boil down the features to an MVP that will get things rolling.</p>

    <div class="page-copy-section about-section">
      <h3 class="page-copy-header">Where I want to be</h3>

      <p class="page-copy">A small startup that wants to build a great product to solve an interesting problem. I want to work with people who aren't afraid to experiment and take risks, trust the people working alongside them, and have a deep respect for the power of small teams working closely together towards a common goal.</p>
