    <p class="grab-copy">I'm a product designer and tech-nerd, or just another sci-fi junkie born in NYC and raised on the 1984 Macintosh. I like to solve interesting problems by designing simple solutions that look good. Take me to your startup, I'll improve your digital stuff.</p>

      <p class="page-copy">Give me any design, and I can prototype it in HTML and SASS, with a dash of Javascript. Show me an interface, and I will refine it to a shining polish with nary a pixel missed. Describe a product's context and goal, and I will boil down the features to an MVP that will get things rolling.</p>

      <h3 class="page-copy-header">Where I want to be</h3>

      <p class="page-copy">A small startup that wants to build a great product to solve an interesting problem. I want to work with people who aren't afraid to experiment and take risks, trust the people working alongside them, and have a deep respect for the power of small teams working closely together towards a common goal.</p>
